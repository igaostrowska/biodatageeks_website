I graduated in Computer Science from WEITI in 2009. For 10 years, I was professionally involved in the financial industry, working as an IT Solutions Architect. In 2017, I began my doctoral studies at WEITI, under the supervision of Dr. hab. inż. Tomasz Gambin, focusing on developing scalable algorithms for analyzing and processing genomic data from large-scale experiments. Since November 2018, I have also held the position of assistant at the ZSI Department. In 2020, I received the First-Degree Scientific Award from the Rector.
